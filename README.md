# DichromaVR
DichromaVR is a mobile-based virtual reality application created with Unity to detect dichromatism or partial colourblindness.
DichromaVR simulates two of the most well-known colour blind test in the world: The Ishihara Plates Test and The D15 Farnsworth-Munsell Test.
The game is created with Unity & Google Cardboard XR SDK. 
This game was created for my bachelors thesis project. 
I'll be sharing more of the details on Medium, put pictures, and add a demo video soon!

Please stay tuned!ðŸ˜Š
Feel free to reach me if you want to ask anything about the project.
